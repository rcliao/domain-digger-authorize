# Authorize Domain Digger

A GoLang CLI to dig domain and log its Authority Section.

I'm using this GoLang script to check a list of domains to see if the company potentially owns the domain or what not.

## Usage

*Example file format*

```
www.google.com
```

```
go run main.go {path to file}
```
